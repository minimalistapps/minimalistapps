          We are husband and wife, we are here to make mobile apps to share with everyone.
          My husband with long years of experience in mobile development and I am a freelance writer.
          Childbearing soon after marriage, and a busy life makes us understand the meaning of simple but productive things.
          That is the reason for <b><i>/minimalist/ - less is more</i></b> born.
